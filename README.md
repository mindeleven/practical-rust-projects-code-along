# Code Along with Practical Rust Projects

This repository has the sole purpose of learning the Rust programming language while coding along with the printed book Practical Rust Projects by Shing Lyu and Andrew Rzeznik. It is a personal documentation of moving forward in my learning journey.

## Practical Rust Projects: Build Serverless, AI, Machine Learning, Embedded, Game, and Web Applications

Code examples and most of the explanations I've added as comments are borrowed from Practical Rust Projects by Shing Lyu and Andrew Rzeznik.
